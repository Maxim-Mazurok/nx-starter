<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="450"></p>

> This project was initially generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). I changed it in a way to be minimal, scalable and maintainable.The general idea about the features and modules has been inspired by other boilerplate of mine [Next boilerplate](https://github.com/movahedan/next-boilerplate)

## Features

- [x] TS configs are configured in an opinionated style you may need in the project
- [x] Clean output directory you can use with ease and confident
- [x] Powerful scalable formatter, linter, husky, and lint-staged for commits 
- [x] Yarn workspace to install rare packages like Cypress and Storybook only where they're needed
- [x] Next.js application, with Dynamic layout supports
- [x] Sample React UI library with styled-components, that supports Storybook and Unit testing
- [x] Analytics module to be able to ease the analytics process and usages
- [x] Fetcher module that is pure fetch that can be extends
- [x] Media Queries feature to be able to make responsive pages in JavaScript

- [ ] Add a ReactNative application
